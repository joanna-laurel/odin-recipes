    <h2>recipe and instructions</h2>

    <p><b>servings: 4 | ingredients: 7ish | prep time: 30 min</b></p>
    <p>This is a super basic recipe for making alfredo sauce while cooking fettucine for it to go on. (It does assume you know how to follow instructions for cooking pasta from a box.)</p><p>If you want to attempt doing three things at once, saute some vegetables while you're making the sauce and waiting for the noodles to cook. Fettucine alfredo is good topped with mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli, bell peppers, eggplant, or probably whatever sounds like a good idea to you.</p>
