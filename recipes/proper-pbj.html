    <h2>ingredients and instructions</h2>

    <p><b>servings: 1 | ingredients: 3 | prep time: depends on specifications</b></p>
    <p>PB&J is a deceptively simple-sounding item that is easy to make incorrectly. The proper way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to follow the precise specifications of the person who will be eating it.</p><p>This recipe will guide you through that process to prevent fatal errors in about 85% of PB&J instances. Please note that it does not, for instance, cover advanced custom slicing methods. However, the sandwich engineering skills you learn here will assist you in leveling up as required. In fact, they should help you execute better in most high-stakes sandwich-making situations.</p>

    <b><ul><li>peanut butter, correct brand and texture</li><li>spreadable fruit substance, correct fruit(s), consistency, and sweetness</li><li>bread, also correct in all senses</li><li>banana, optional (occasionally requested in place of spreadable fruit substance)</li></ul></b>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol><li>Find out if this is a standard or open-faced sandwich, and select the correct number of bread slices. Note: for a standard sandwich, be sure your bread stays aligned during this process. In other words, after pb & j have been applied, your sandwich should close back up so the same sides are together as were together in the bag. This prevents any disturbing shape/size mismatches in asymmetrical/tapered bread loaves. (Virtually all bread loaves are at least slightly asymmetrical!)</li><li>Ask if the bread should be toasted, and if so how much, then toast (or don't).<li>Apply peanut butter to one slice of bread. Check to see if you have applied the correct amount and adjust as necessary. Important application note for both peanut butter and jelly: spread that stuff at a uniform thickness to the very edges of the bread! Unless otherwise specified, your end result should not result in bites that are a.) mostly bread and/or b.) way gooier than elsewhere. </li><ul><li>Open-faced sandwich: add jelly on top of peanut butter delicately so as not to mix them together.</li><li>Standard sandwich: add jelly to second piece of bread. Just before spreading the jelly is a good time to check that your slices are still aligned with each other, as explained in step 1. Verify proper jelly amount, and close sandwich.</li></ul><li>Find out if the crust is to remain on the sandwich and act accordingly.</li><li>Verify cut of sandwich. Please gauge your cutting precisely to subdivide sandwich directly in half at each step. This is not the time to get messy and destroy all the good work you've already done. Judicious knife selection is also important! You want to slice the sandwich, not squish it down in the middle while the contents ooze out the sides. Popular sandwich slicing choices include: <ul><li>unsliced</li><li>sliced in half diagonally (big triangles)</li><li>sliced in quarters diagonally (small triangles)</li><li>sliced in half top to bottom (long rectangles)</li><li>sliced in quarters (small rectangles that may or may not be squares)</li></ul></li><li>Serve the sandwich on an appropriate plate</li><li>Alternate (banana) route: If called upon to swap out the fruit spread for a banana (yes, technically this is now a pb&b), please apply the sandwich inquiry skills you learned above to ask appropriate questions re: cutting and arranging the banana on the sandwich. Note that even for standard (two-slice) sandwiches, banana slices should always be placed on the peanut butter directly for better adherence. In some cases the correct method will be to apply peanut butter to both slices (after double-checking for proper bread alignment) so that it surrounds the banana slices evenly within the bread.</li></ol>
